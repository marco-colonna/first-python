# Take your first steps with Python

My work from following the Microsoft Docs Learning Path [Take your first steps with Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/python-first-steps/).

*Completed on 8/14/2021.*

## Modules in this learning path

[**What is Python?**](#) - A quick introduction to Python, programming languages, compilation, and the process of programming.

[**Set up your Python beginner development environment with Visual Studio Code**](#) - Get started with learning Python by installing and configuring the tools you'll need to build real applications.

[**Create your first Python program**](first-program) - Get started with Python by writing code to interact with end users.

[**Branch code execution with the if and else statements in Python**](branch-code) - Use the if statement Boolean expressions with comparison and logic operators to express decision logic.

[**Manipulate and format string data for display in Python**](format-string-data) - Use built-in features of the string class and other helper methods to control string data.

[**Perform mathematical operations on numeric data in Python**](mathematical-operations) - Convert user input to numeric values, and use mathematical operators to perform calculations.

[**Import standard library modules to add features to Python programs**](standard-library) - Explore the Python standard library, how to add a module to your program, and how to download third-party packages.

[**Iterate through code blocks by using the while statement**](iterate) - Use the while statement and related Python code constructs to add looping logic to your programs.

[**Manage a sequence of data by using Python lists**](lists) - Learn how to use lists to manage a collection of data. Use helper functions to manipulate the list. Use the for statement to iterate through the list.

[**Create reusable functionality with functions in Python**](functions) - Define functions to create encapsulated modular code that accept input and return results.
